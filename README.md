# Microsoft Teams Recording Rename
Someone at MS Teams had the big idea of naming the recording files as **MEETING_NAME-YEARMONTHDAY-TIMEHERE.mp4** and that's ðŸ‘Ž.
So this python code should rename them to **DAY-MONTH-YEAR.mp4**
# Note
Make sure to place the videos in a folder and change the directory folder in the code.
